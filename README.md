# contributors

<!-- <img src='assets/demo.png' title='Example' alt='Example'/> -->

Inspired by GitHub and GitLab's contribution calendar graphs. I've used both services over the last couple of years, so I figured it'd be nice to see a single view of all my contributions.

### Next steps
I'm planning on adding the specific day view similar to how GitHub shows the exact commit and PR details for a day when clicked. In this case, it'll show the activity on both services combined.

### Built with
