# contributors

<!-- <img src='assets/demo.png' title='Example' alt='Example'/> -->

Inspired by GitHub and GitLab's contribution calendar graphs. I've used both services over the last couple of years, so I figured it'd be nice to see a single view of all my contributions.

### Next steps
I'm planning on adding the specific day view similar to how GitHub shows the exact commit and PR details for a day when clicked. In this case, it'll show post and comment details.

### Built with
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) - Great tool for building graphics, seems like GitHub also used d3 for its heatmap.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Yes, it is still super handy for DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Great for the lazy developer that can't design properly.
